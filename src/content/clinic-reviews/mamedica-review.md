# Mamedica Clinic Review: The Value-for-Life Option

Mamedica has built a reputation as the "value-for-life" player in the UK medical cannabis space by front-loading its professional fees and then stretching mandatory reviews to once every twelve months. After a £150 initial video consultation, follow-ups drop to £75 a year, and repeat prescriptions are free, giving Mamedica the lowest long-term consultation cost in the market—just £75 annually from year two onward.

## Quick Overview

| **Established** | 2020 |
| **Location** | 78 Harley Street, London |
| **Consultation Types** | Video, Phone |
| **Initial Consultation** | £150 |
| **Annual Follow-up** | £75 |
| **Prescription Fee** | Free |

2. Confirm at least two conventional therapies have failed
3. Screen for contraindications
4. Develop "start-low, go-slow" titration plan
5. Provide educational resources and dosage diaries
